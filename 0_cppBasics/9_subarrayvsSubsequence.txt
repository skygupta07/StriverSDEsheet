Consider an array: {1,2,3,4}

Subarray: contiguous sequence in an array i.e.

{1,2},{1,2,3}
{2,3}


Subsequence: Need not to be contiguous, but maintains order i.e.
{1,2,4}   -> possible ki beech se element gayab....


Subset: Same as subsequence except it has empty set i.e.
{1,3},{}


Given an array/sequence of size n, possible

Subset = 2^n
Subseqeunce = (2^n) -1 (non-empty subsequences)
Subarray = n*(n+1)/2
